## Summary

This is a detached fork of the [UAD project](https://github.com/0x192/universal-android-debloater), which aims to improve privacy and battery performance by removing unnecessary and obscure system apps.
This can also contribute to improving security by reducing (but not eliminating) [the attack surface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface). Read the [wiki](https://github.com/Universal-Debloater-Alliance/universal-android-debloater-next-generation/wiki) for more details on getting started. Whilst UAD-ng can remove system apps, it cannot detect or remove potentially malicious system services or drivers baked into the firmware of your device by various vendors; some vendor-specific apps are only UI front-ends to vendor-provided system services, and as such disabling/uninstalling those apps will not stop a service from running. Additional information can be found in package descriptions inside the Universal Android Debloater Next Generation application.

## Documentation

For documentation regarding how to use UAD-ng, the FAQ, building from source and how to decompile/extract APKs, see [our Wiki](https://github.com/Universal-Debloater-Alliance/universal-android-debloater-next-generation/wiki).
